      "Question": "Describe your experience with React.js, including specific projects where you utilized it and the challenges you faced.",
      "Answer": "In my previous role, I used React.js to build a single-page application for managing user accounts. This involved implementing features like user authentication, profile management, and data visualization. One challenge I faced was optimizing component rendering for improved performance, which I addressed by using techniques like memoization and React.memo.  I also worked on a smaller project using React Native to build a mobile app prototype.  This experience gave me insight into the differences between web and mobile development within the React ecosystem. "

      "Question": "Explain your understanding of Java and its application in the context of a software development project. Provide a concrete example.",
      "Answer": "I have experience with Java in building backend systems. For example, in a previous project, I used Spring Boot to develop a RESTful API for a social media platform. This involved designing database schemas, implementing controllers to handle requests, and utilizing various Spring components for dependency injection and security.  I'm familiar with concepts like object-oriented programming, multithreading, and exception handling within Java."

    {
      "Question": "Walk me through your approach to solving a Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problem.  Let's consider the problem of finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.",
      "Answer": "My approach to DSA problems involves several steps: 1) Understanding the problem thoroughly and identifying the constraints. 2) Choosing an appropriate data structure (like an adjacency matrix or adjacency list for a graph). 3) Selecting an algorithm (like Dijkstra's algorithm or A* search for shortest path). 4) Implementing the chosen algorithm efficiently, considering time and space complexity. 5) Testing the solution with various inputs and edge cases. For the shortest path problem, I would likely use Dijkstra's algorithm due to its efficiency for finding shortest paths in weighted graphs."

      "Question": "How do you handle conflicts when working on a team project, particularly in a version control system like Git?",
      "Answer": "I utilize Git for version control and regularly use branching strategies for collaborative development. When conflicts arise, I first try to resolve them locally by carefully examining the changes in the conflicting files. I prioritize understanding the intent of the changes from both branches. If local resolution is not straightforward, I communicate with my team members to understand the context of their changes and work together to integrate them effectively.  We use pull requests and code reviews to minimize such conflicts, ensuring that changes are reviewed before merging."

    {
      "Question": "Describe a time you had to debug a complex issue in your code. What strategies did you use, and what was the outcome?",
      "Answer": "In one project, we experienced intermittent failures in our data processing pipeline.  To debug this, I started by using logging statements to track the data flow. I then utilized a debugger to step through the code, examine variable values at different points, and identify the exact location of the error.  The issue turned out to be a race condition due to inconsistent thread synchronization. By adding appropriate locks and using thread-safe data structures, we resolved the issue and improved the pipeline's reliability."
